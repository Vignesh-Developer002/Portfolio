                <P>AutoCAD is a 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application developed by Autodesk.[1] It
                    was first released in December 1982 for the CP/M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on
                    microcomputers with internal graphics [2] Initially a DOS application, subsequent versions were
                    later released for other platforms including Classic Mac OS (1992), Microsoft Windows (1993) and
                    macOS (2010), iOS (2010), and Android (2011).
                    Subscriptions to the desktop version of AutoCAD include access to the web and mobile applications.
                    However, users can subscribe separately to the AutoCAD Web App online or AutoCAD Mobile through an
                    in-app purchase</p>
                <p>AutoCAD is a general drafting and design application used in industry by architects, project
                    managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners, and other professionals to prepare technical
                    drawings. After discontinuing the sale of perpetual licenses in January 2016,[3] commercial versions
                    of AutoCAD are licensed through a term-based subscription or Autodesk Flex, a pay-as-you-go option
                    introduced on September 24, 2021.</p>

                <h3>REVIT ARCHITECTURE</h3>
                <p>Autodesk Revit is a building information modelling software for architects, structural engineers,
                    mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, design for contractors. The original software
                    was developed by Charles River Software, founded in 1997, renamed Revit Technology Corporation in
                    2000, and acquired by Autodesk in 2002.
                    The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, annotate the
                    model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model's
                    database.[1] Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and
                    track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance
                    and/or demolition.</p>

                <p>V-Ray is a biased computer-generated imagery rendering software application developed by Bulgarian
                    software company Chaos . V-Ray is a commercial plug-in for third-party 3D computer graphics software
                    applications
                    And is used for visualizations and computer graphics in industries such as media, entertainment,
                    film and video game production, industrial design, product design and architecture.</p>

                <h3>3DS MAX &LUMION</h3>
                <p>Autodesk 3ds Max, formerly 3D Studio and 3D Studio Max, is a professional 3D computer graphics
                    program for making 3D animations, models, games and images. It is developed and produced by Autodesk
                    Media and Entertainment.[3] It has modeling capabilities and a flexible plugin architecture and must
                    be used on the Microsoft Windows platform.</p>
                <p>It is frequently used by video game developers, many TV commercial studios, and architectural
                    visualization studios. It is also used for movie effects and movie pre-visualization. 3ds Max
                    features shaders (such as ambient occlusion and subsurface scattering), dynamic simulation, particle
                    systems, radiosity, normal map creation and rendering, global illumination, a customizable user
                    interface, and its own scripting language.</p>

                <h3>NAVISWORK 5D</h3>
                <p>Used primarily in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries to complement 3D
                    design packages (such as Autodesk Revit, AutoCAD, and MicroStation), Navisworks allows users to open
                    and combine 3D models;</p>
                <p>Navigate around them in real-time (without the WASD possibility); and review the model using a set of
                    tools including comments, redlining, viewpoint, and measurements. A selection of plug-ins enhances
                    the package adding interference detection, 4D time simulation, photorealistic rendering and PDF-like
                    publishing</p>

                <h3>PRIMAVERA P6</h3>
                <p>As of 2008 Primavera Systems supported long-established products - P3 and Sure-Trak - and the newer
                    P6 version. The long-standing P3 product in its various forms was used by 25% of the heavy
                    construction industry, its predominant customer base; the next most popular software was used by
                    11%.[4] Nearly 40% of general contractors with an annual revenue of $5M to $10M used Primavera P3.
                    In comparison,</p>
                <p>The P6 version did not register in a CFMA 2008 survey of the United States construction industry. The
                    P3 version to P6 version change is based in a move from DOS-type shortcut keys to mouse-based icons.
                    Thus, a software application that was once very fast to use but grounded in shortcut functions
                    (which some users found difficult to master) <br><br>Moved to a mouse-based application that is
                    quick to learn but once mastered never achieves the same speed of use. The Primavera Project Planner
                    DOS core launched in 1983[5] and the P3 Windows interface launched in 1994.</p>

                    was formerly known as Xsteel (X as in X Window System, the foundation of the Unix GUI)</p>
