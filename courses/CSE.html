                <p>Ethical hackers are employed by organizations to penetrate networks and computer systems with the
                    purpose of finding and fixing security vulnerabilities. The EC-Council offers another certification,
                    known as Certified Network Defense Architect (CNDA). This certification is designed for United
                    States Government agencies and is available only to members of selected agencies including some
                    private government contractors, primarily in compliance to DOD Directive 8570.01-M.[2] It is also
                    ANSI accredited and is recognized as a GCHQ Certified Training (GCT).</p>

            <h2>CYBER SECURITY :</h2>
            <p>This is a list of cybersecurity information technology. Cybersecurity is security as it is applied to
                information technology. This includes all technology that stores, manipulates, or moves data, such as
                computers, data networks, and all devices connected to or included in networks, such as routers and
                switches. All information technology devices and facilities need to be secured against intrusion,
                unauthorized </p>
            <p>Additionally, the users of information technology should be protected from theft of assets, extortion,
                identity theft, loss of privacy and confidentiality of personal information, malicious mischief, damage
                to equipment, business process compromise, and the general activity of cybercriminals. The public should
                be protected against acts of cyberterrorism, such as the compromise or loss of the electric power grid.

            <h2>UI/UX DESIGNER :</h2>
            <P>User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD) defines the experience a user would go through when
                interacting with a company, its services, and its products.[1] User experience design is a user centered
                design approach because it considers the user's experience when using a product or platform.[2]
                Research, data analysis, and test results drive design decisions in UX design rather than aesthetic
                preferences and opinions.</P>
            <p>Unlike user interface design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer interface, UX design
                encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product or website, such as its
                usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance. UX design is also an
                element of the customer experience (CX), and encompasses all aspects and stages of a customer's
                experience and interaction with a company.</P>

            <h2>MACHINE LEARNING :</h2>
            <P>Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and
                study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform
                tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass
                many previous approaches in performance.[2][3]

                ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech
                recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.[4][5] When applied to business problems, it is
                known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based,
                computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.</P>

                <h2>ARITIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE :</h2>
                <P>Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines,
                    particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and
                    studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning
                    and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such
                    machines may be called AIs.</P>

                <p>AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile
                    applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used
                    by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and
                    Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art);
                    and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).[2]</P>

            <h2>c,c++, IOT, PYTHON :</h2>

            <h3>PYTHON :</h3>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</p>

            <h3>C :</h3>
            <p>C (pronounced like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the
                1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly
                reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device
                drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[7] C is commonly
                used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest
                microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>

            <p> A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between
                1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of
                the Unix operating system.</p>

            <h3>IOT :</h3>
            <P>The Internet of things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other
                technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other
                communications networks.[1][2][3][4][5] The Internet of things encompasses electronics, communication,
                and computer science engineering. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do
                not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network[6] and be
                individually addressable.</P>

        <section class="java same">
            <h2>JAVA, WEB DESIGNING :</h2>

            <h3>JAVA :</h3>
            <P>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled
                to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
                architecture.</P>
            <P> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The
                Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
                typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</P>


            <h3>WEB DESIGNING :</h3>
            <P>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
                design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
                design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
                aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</P>
            <P>[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end
                (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web
                engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of
                usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</P>
