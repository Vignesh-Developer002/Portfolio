                <P>AutoCAD is a 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application developed by Autodesk.[1] It
                    was first released in December 1982 for the CP/M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on
                    microcomputers with internal graphics [2] Initially a DOS application, subsequent versions were
                    later released for other platforms including Classic Mac OS (1992), Microsoft Windows (1993) and
                    macOS (2010), iOS (2010), and Android (2011).
                    Subscriptions to the desktop version of AutoCAD include access to the web and mobile applications.
                    However, users can subscribe separately to the AutoCAD Web App online or AutoCAD Mobile through an
                    in-app purchase</p>
                <p>AutoCAD is a general drafting and design application used in industry by architects, project
                    managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners, and other professionals to prepare technical
                    drawings. After discontinuing the sale of perpetual licenses in January 2016,[3] commercial versions
                    of AutoCAD are licensed through a term-based subscription or Autodesk Flex, a pay-as-you-go option
                    introduced on September 24, 2021.</p>

                <h3>CATIA</h3>
                <p>CATIA (an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), 3D modeling and product lifecycle management (PLM), developed by the French company Dassault Systèmes.Since it supports multiple stages of product development from conceptualization, design and engineering to manufacturing, it is considered a CAx-software and is sometimes referred to as a 3D product lifecycle management software suite. Like most of its competition it facilitates collaborative engineering through an integrated cloud service and have support to be used across disciplines including surfacing & shape design, electrical, fluid and electronic systems design, mechanical engineering and systems engineering.</p>

                <h3>SOLID WORKS</h3>
                <p>SolidWorks (stylized as SOLIDWORKS) is a brand within Dassault Systèmes that develops and markets solid modeling computer-aided design, computer-aided engineering, 3D CAD design and collaboration, analysis, and product data management software.[2]

                    The SolidWorks brand was founded as Winchester Design Systems by Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate Jon Hirschtick on December 30, 1993.[3]
                    
                    SolidWorks developed the world's first 3D CAD application that ran on a desktop PC.[4] They had a simple mission statement of "3D on every engineer's desktop".[5]
                    
                    SolidWorks released its first product, SolidWorks 95, on November 1, 1995. Within two months, it established a new benchmark for ease of use.[6] Since then, the 3D CAD product, now known as SolidWorks, has become a central product for the SolidWorks brand.[2]</p>

                <h3>ANSYS</h3>
                <p>Ansys was founded in 1970 as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc. (SASI) by John Swanson. The idea for Ansys was first conceived by Swanson while working at the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory in the 1960s.[2] At the time, engineers performed finite element analysis (FEA) by hand.[2] Westinghouse rejected Swanson's idea to automate FEA by developing general purpose engineering software, so Swanson left the company in 1969 to develop the software on his own.[2] He founded SASI the next year, working out of his farmhouse in Pittsburgh.[3][4]

                    Swanson developed the initial ANSYS software on punch cards and used a mainframe computer that was rented by the hour.[2] Westinghouse hired him as a consultant, under the condition that any code he developed for Westinghouse could also be included in the Ansys product line.[3] Westinghouse became the first Ansys user.[3]</p>

                <h3>NX CAD/CAM</h3>
                <p>Both CAD and CAM are computer-intensive. Although, in 1981, Computervision was #1 and IBM was #2, IBM had a major advantage: its systems could accommodate "eight to 20" users at a time, whereas most competitors only had enough power to accommodate "four to six."[3] CAD/CAM was described by The New York Times as a "computerized design and manufacturing process" that made its debut "when Computervision pioneered it in the 1970's."[1]

                    Other 1980s major players in CAD/CAM included General Electric[4] and Parametric Technology Corporation;[5] the latter subsequently acquired Computervision, which had been acquired by Prime Computer.[5]
                    
                    CAD/CAM originated in the 1960s;[6] an IBM 360/44 was used to build via CNC[7][8] the wings of an airplane.</p>

                <p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels, and senior living facilities; medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals; vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines; and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.

                    Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air. Methods for ventilating a building are divided into mechanical/forced and natural types.[2]</p>

                <h3>REVIT MEP</h3>
                <p>Autodesk Revit is a building information modelling software for architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, design for contractors. The original software was developed by Charles River Software, founded in 1997, renamed Revit Technology Corporation in 2000, and acquired by Autodesk in 2002. The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the building model's database.[1] Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.</p>
