            <h2>AUTOCAD 2D</h2>
            <p>AutoCAD is a 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application developed by Autodesk.[1] It was
                first released in December 1982 for the CP/M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on
                microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.[2] Initially a DOS application, subsequent versions
                were later released for other platforms including Classic Mac OS (1992), Microsoft Windows (1993) and
                macOS (2010), iOS (2010), and Android (2011).</p>

            <p>AutoCAD is a general drafting and design application used in industry by architects, project managers,
                engineers, graphic designers, city planners, and other professionals to prepare technical drawings.</p>

            <h2>REVIT MEP</h2>
            <p>Autodesk Revit is a building information modelling software for architects, structural engineers,
                mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, design for contractors. The original software was
                developed by Charles River Software, founded in 1997, renamed Revit Technology Corporation in 2000, and
                acquired by Autodesk in 2002.</p>
            <p>The software allows users to design a building and structure and its
            components in 3D, annotate the model with 2D drafting elements, and access building information from the
            building model's database.[1] Revit is 4D building information modeling application capable with tools to
            plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle, from concept to construction and later
            maintenance and/or demolition.</p>

            <h2>PLC DESIGNING</h2>
            <p>A printed circuit board (PCB), also called printed wiring board (PWB), is a medium used to connect or
                "wire" components to one another in a circuit. It takes the form of a laminated sandwich structure of
                conductive and insulating layers: each of the conductive layers is designed with a pattern of traces,
                planes and other features (similar to wires on a flat surface) etched from one or more sheet layers of
                copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate.</p>
            <p>[1] Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers in the shape designed to
                accept the component's terminals, generally by means of soldering, to both electrically connect and
                mechanically fasten them to it. Another manufacturing process adds vias, plated-through holes that allow
                interconnections between layers.</p>

            <h2>PLC & SCADA</h2>
            <p>SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a control system architecture comprising computers,
                networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and
                processes. It also covers sensors and other devices, such as programmable logic controllers, which
                interface with process plant or machinery.</p>

            <p>The operator interfaces which enable monitoring and the issuing of process commands, such as controller
                setpoint changes, are handled through the SCADA computer system. The subordinated operations, e.g. the
                real-time control logic or controller calculations, are performed by networked modules connected to the
                field sensors and actuators.</p>

            <p>The SCADA concept was developed to be a universal means of remote-access to a variety of local control
                modules, which could be from different manufacturers and allowing access through standard automation
                protocols. In practice, large SCADA systems have grown to become similar to distributed control systems
                in function, while using multiple means of interfacing with the plant. They can control large-scale
                processes that can span multiple sites, and work over large distances. It is one of the most
                commonly-used types of industrial control systems.</p>

            <h2>E-TAP & SP3D</h2>
            <p>Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) is an electrical network modeling and simulation software
                tool[1] used by power systems engineers to create an "electrical digital twin" and analyze electrical
                power system dynamics,[2] transients and protection.[3]

                Dr. Farrokh Shokooh is the founder of ETAP. While Dr. Shokooh worked at Fluor Corporation[4] he was made
                in charge of selecting electrical engineering software. Realizing a lack of comprehensive, efficient and
                intelligent power system analysis software, the vision of Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP)
                was born.</p>
            <p>Dr. Shokooh left Fluor Corporation to develop ETAP and founded Operation Technology, Inc (OTI) in 1986.
                OTI dba ETAP is an ISO 9001-certified electrical power system design and automation software company
                headquartered in Irvine, California, with international offices in India, UAE, KSA, Brazil, Mexico,
                France, UK, Malaysia and China.</p>

            <h2>EMBEDDED SYSTEM</h2>
            <p>Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory
                and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral
                interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the
                processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of
                computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated
                processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).</p>

            <p>Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the
                size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are
                mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.</p>
